{"name":"Squirreltowerdefense","tagline":"CMSC 331 Project 2","body":"<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacobrust/SquirrelTowerDefense/master/presentationImages/Logo.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\nMax Morawski is a UMBC student who was kicked out of his apartment and forced to live on top of the school library, surviving off of squirrels he would trap. This upset the other squirrels on campus. These other squirrels have decided to attack the library and put a stop to Max once and for all. You must build towers and traps to stop the squirrels and defend the library!\r\n</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacobrust/SquirrelTowerDefense/master/presentationImages/screenShot1.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\nThe squirrels will attack in waves. Prior to each wave you have time to prepare. If a squirrel reaches the library you lose a life. Defend against every wave and you win. Drop below 0 lives and you lose. You only have a set amount of wood to build the defenses with, so spend wisely! Wood is gained from defeating squirrels and beating waves.\r\n</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacobrust/SquirrelTowerDefense/master/presentationImages/screenShot2.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\nChange the type of defense you are going to build by selecting from the box in the upper right corner. The cost to build the defense is specified next to the name. Click on any open space to build your selected defense. If you misplace a tower, no problem! Select the tower and destroy it for a full refund.\r\n</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacobrust/SquirrelTowerDefense/master/presentationImages/screenShot3.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\nTry to come up with interesting mazes for the squirrels to run through! Maximize your towersâ€™ chances to attack!\r\n</p>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
