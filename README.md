SquirrelTowerDefense
====================

This is a multiplatform video game that started as a group project for our Programming Languages class.

A description of the game can be found at: http://sqordfish.github.io/SquirrelTowerDefense

The game was built on the LibGDX engine. I totally recommend using it for any any small game development! It was 
much easier to test the game with a desktop version rather than in an Android VM (the project was required to run
on Android).
