SquirrelTowerDefense
====================

This is a multiplatform video game that started as a project for CMSC 331 (Programming Languages) at 
University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Our group consisted of Jacob Rust, Vincent Liu, and Bryan Jarrell. 

A description of the game can be found at: http://jacobrust.github.io/SquirrelTowerDefense

The game was built on the LibGDX engine. I totally recommend using it for any any small game development! It was 
much easier to test the game with a desktop version rather than in an Android VM (the project was required to run
on Android).
